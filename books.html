    <p>Books are an amazing creation.</p>

    <p>More so, Audible. I recommend giving it a try if you're trying 
        to acquire worldly knowledge in the easiest fashion I've found so far.
        Information just flows into you, you don't have to seek for it.
    </p>

    <p>I never appreciated books until I went to college and started watching
        videos about influential people in the world. A common theme among them
        was their interest in books.
    </p>

    <p>I often try to incorporate this into a habit. I now understand the power
        books. You can dive into someone's thought stream. It gets us closer to
        achieving telepathic communication. It's very nice.
