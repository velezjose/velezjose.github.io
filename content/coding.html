        <h2>Apps</h2>

        <p>Some apps I would like to code one day in my free time, or you might
            want to try yourself:
        </p>

        <p>Song-synchronizing App: Haven't seen an app that can connect with other
            phones and synchronize the song to be played in all phones.
        </p>

        <p>Birthday Reminder: You can have something written for your friends or 
            family weeks in advance use this app to send a message to them on 
            their beloved day. It might even find some market into automated 
            gifts system :).
