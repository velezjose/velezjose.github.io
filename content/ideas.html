    <p>My mind sometimes spawns ideas out of the blue. Here are some of them.</p>


    <h1>The Idea Lab</h1>

    <p>Thinking you know exactly where you&#8217;ll be is a kind of lack of
        humility that doesn't let you invent. - Jeff Bezos
    </p>

    <h2>Simple ideas for the future:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Space parachute: Why deal with the Russian Soyuz if you can 
        just jump from low-Earth orbit? This is not a new idea, but I've given
        it a bit of thought.
        </li>

        <li>Brain processor extension: <a target="_blank" 
        href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink</a>
        -related, and probably in Neuralink's plans once they figure out how
        to create the neural lace.
        </li>
		
        <li>Air-purifying drones: <a target="_blank" 
            href="http://www.popsci.com/air-pollution-death">Air pollution
            kills thousands a year.</a> Let's solve this.
        </li>
		
        <li>Ultrafast (Hyperloop-like) transportation in Puerto Rico: This 
            idea was introduced to me by my friend Carolina.
        </li>
		
        <li>Increased drone usage: Drones are like the Internet in the late
            90s. I feel like we ought to use drones a lot more to deliver things.
            This will, obviously, increase the restrictions on the things that will 
            be delivered.
        </li>
    </ul>
