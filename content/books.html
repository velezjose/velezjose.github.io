        <p>Books are an amazing creation.</p>

        <p>More so, Audible. I recommend giving it a try if you're trying 
            to acquire worldly knowledge in the easiest fashion I've found so far.
            Information just flows into you, you don't have to seek for it.
        </p>

        <p>I never appreciated books until I went to college and started watching
            videos about influential people in the world. A common theme among them
            was their interest in books.
        </p>

        <p>I often try to incorporate this into a habit. I now understand the power
            books. You can dive into someone's thought stream. It gets us closer to
            achieving telepathic communication. It's very nice.
