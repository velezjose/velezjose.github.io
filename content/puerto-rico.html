        <h1>Boricua</h1>

        <p>Born and raised in Guaynabo, I developed as a child and teenager in San
            Juan while fostering what are now some truly intimate friendships.
        </p>


        <p>I would like for Puerto Rico to optimize its resources more effectively. 
            I think there are lots of ways the government and people can work to 
            achieve this.
        </p>

        <p>My friend has a <blog on this if you want his perspective on current
            issues that are being faced in the island.
        </p>

        <h2>The Beach</h2>

        <p>More on this soon..</p>
