    <h2>Apps</h2>

    <p>Some apps I would like to code one day in my free time, or you might
        want to try yourself:
    </p>

    <p>Song-synchronizing App: Haven't seen an app that can connect with other
        phones and synchronize the song to be played in all phones.
    </p>

    <p>Birthday Reminder: You can have something written for your friends or 
        family weeks in advance use this app to send a message to them on 
        their beloved day. It might even find some market into automated 
        gifts system :).
