    <h1>My Online Library</h1>
    <p>
       I never appreciated books until I got to college and started watching videos about influential people in the world, especially this one dude out there – the <strong>real</strong> Iron Man –.<br>
       <br>
       There&#8217;s a pattern in these types of people, at least one element in their <em>formula for success: <strong> they&#8217;ve all consumed hella books for fun and curiosity, and still continue to do so. </strong></em><br>
       <br>
       So I decided to incorporate this habit.<br><br> I now understand the power of a book. <em>You can just feel and swim in someone&#8217;s thought stream. </em>Incredible!<br>
       <br>
