    <h1>The Idea Lab</h1>
      <p>
         I am not an idea factory, however I try to be creative and curious. I like writing new ideas on my iPhone and texting them to friends (notably <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhil-ramanathan-a52957a4/">Nick</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://austinkemper.github.io/">AK</a>). Ya know, tryna make as much use of my <a target="_blank" href="https://futurism.com/darpa-were-moving-to-merge-humans-and-machines/">digital tertiary layer</a>.<br>
      <br>
         If I ever remember them, I can ignite an intellectually stimulating conversation and bring it up as a table topic. Who knows, <em>in the beginning, everything was just an idea</em>.
      </p>

    <h2>Simple ideas for the future:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Space parachute: Why deal with the Russian Soyuz if you can just jump from LEO? Still not sure about the materials needed, though.
      </li>

      <li>Brain processor chip extension: <a target="_blank" href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink</a>-related, details may be more complex than estimated.
      </li>
		
      <li>Air-purifying drones: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.popsci.com/air-pollution-death">Air pollution kills thousands a year.</a> Let&#8217;s solve this.
      </li>
		
      <li>Hyperloop-like Transportation in Puerto Rico: This idea was introduced to me by my friend Carolina.
      </li>
		
      <li>Increased drone usage: Drones are like the Internet in the late 90&#8217;s)
      </li>
		
      <li>Magnetic Engineers (still thinking about this one)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Apps</h2>
		
    <p>Some apps I would like to code one day in my free time, or you might want to try yourself:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Songmatching App:
	<p>I know, I know, Shazam already exists.. but it doesn&#8217;t let you synchronize songs with other people if you&#8217;re using different devices.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>Birthday Reminder:
	<p>You can have something written for your friends or family weeks in advance use this app to send a message to them on their beloved day. It might even find some market into automated gifts system :).
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Some Amateur Coding</h2> 

      <p>My friend <a target="_blank" href="https://austinkemper.github.io/">AK</a> showed me this binary search algorithm:
      </p>
	<code>def binarySearch(alist, item):<br>
	    first &#61; 0<br>
	    last &#61; len(alist)-1<br>
	    found &#61; False<br>
	    <br>
	    while first &#60; &#61;last and not found:<br>
	        midpoint &#61; (first + last)//2<br>
	        if alist[midpoint] &#61;&#61; item:<br>
	            found &#61; True<br>
	        else:<br>
	            if item &#60;&nbsp;alist[midpoint]:<br>
	                last &#61; midpoint-1<br>
	            else:<br>
	                first &#61; midpoint+1<br>
			<br>
	    return found
	</code>
